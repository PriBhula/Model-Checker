## Overview

Automata Concocter is developed using the [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) framework.  

### Building / Distributing

-----------------------
Run the build task using `gradlew build` inside modelchecker. This will take care of web dependencies and will give you a single executable jar.

### Main Application

-----------------------
The Automata Concocter is a web based application that constructs finite state automata based on text input of the
user and was designed as an educational tool for students studying software engineering. The AC allows the user to
define multiple automata and navigate through diffirent edges to reach different states within the user defined state
machines. The user can save defined automata as a txt file and can upload a previously saved txt file with defined
state machines.

###Styles

-----------------------

Main application css files can be found in the styles directory (Model-Checker/app/styles/).

### Animation - Priyanka

-----------------------

For my 489 project, i have implemented an animation tab, where users are able to animate through their models
